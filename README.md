# StarCraft II Python Bot
This repository contains a passive CommandCenterPy-based bot for StarCraft II. It is intended to be a reasonable starting-point for creating your own StarCraft II-playing system.

## Setup for creating your own bot

1. Locate your fork of this repository. This will be automatically created for you when you register in webreg. The repository will be in the [TDDD92-2019 group](https://gitlab.liu.se/tddd92-2019).

2. Now clone your new repository using the following command: `git clone <path>`, where `<path>` is shown when the blue button *Clone* in the top-right corner on your repository page. If you have configured SSH-access, then use the SSH link, otherwise use the HTTP link.

3. Next, setup the library in PyCharm. See [PyCommandCenter's page on PyCharm] for how to do that.

4. Everything is now ready for PyCharm: Start PyCharm, and then select "Open" and navigate to the location you cloned your fork of this repository to.

5. In order to run the code, right click the file named "main.py" in the project panel to the right, and select "Debug main". This will run the code in "main.py", and consequently start StarCraft II. You can also edit the code in "main.py" by double-clicking "main.py".
